## Datasets Repo
- [MalNet](https://mal-net.org/): MalNet is a hierarchical image and graph database designed to assist machine learning and security researchers in developing methods to detect malicious software.
- [SNAP](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html): Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection
- [GraphGT](https://graphgt.github.io/index.html#dataset): A systematic graph generation and transformation dataset collection.
- [TUDataset](https://chrsmrrs.github.io/datasets/): A collection of benchmark datasets for graph classification and regression.

## Benchmark
- [Open-Graph-BenchMark](https://ogb.stanford.edu/): The Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) is a collection of realistic, large-scale, and diverse benchmark datasets for machine learning on graphs. OGB datasets are automatically downloaded, processed, and split using the OGB Data Loader. The model performance can be evaluated using the OGB Evaluator in a unified manner.
- [Google/GraphWorld](https://github.com/google-research/graphworld): GraphWorld is a method and toolbox for graph learning researchers to systematically test new models on synthetic graph datasets.
- [Temporal-Graph-Benchmark](https://tgb.complexdatalab.com/)TGB is a collection of challenging and diverse benchmark datasets for realistic, reproducible, and robust evaluation for machine learning on temporal graphs. TGB includes both dynamic link and node property prediction tasks and an automated pipeline from dataset downloading, dataloading, evaluation and submission to the TGB leaderboard.
